In this assigment you will need to:

1. Create a GitHub ID

2. Create a GitHub Repository (Public or Private it is up to you. In the end it will have to be Public)

3. Add me to your GitHub Repository (my id is esolares so that I can grade it)

4. Perform the data exploration step (i.e. evaluate your data, # of observations, details about your data distributions, scales, missing data, column descriptions) Note: For image data you can still describe your data by the number of classes, # of images, size of images, are sizes standardized? do they need to be cropped? normalized? etc.

5. Plot your data. For tabular data, you will need to run scatters, for image data, you will need to plot your example classes.

6. How will you preprocess your data? You should explain this in your Readme.MD file and link your jupyter notebook to it. Your jupyter notebook should be uploaded to your repo.

7. Jupyter Notebook data download and environment setup requirements: 

              !wget !unzip like functions as well as !pip install functions for non standard libraries not available in colab are required to be in the top section of your jupyter lab notebook. Please see HW2 & HW3 for examples.
